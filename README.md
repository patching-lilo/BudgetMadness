**Introduction**

This repository contains the code for Budget Madness, developed as part of our Part 3 (PORTFOLIO OF EVIDENCE) assignment in the Open-Source Coding course.
The app is designed to help users effectively manage their finances by tracking expenses, monitoring income, and planning for future financial goals.

**Feedback from Lecturer**

In our previous part we were told to make our application colour darker, as well as adding missing features,
like category totals (which we have implemented in this part and is displayed in the YouTube video).

**Programming Language**

This application is built using Kotlin, leveraging our knowledge of the language for Android development.

**Colour Scheme**

The app utilizes a colour scheme of dark green, white, and black for a clean, modern look.

**Database Storage**

For this part of the application, we are using Firebase Realtime Database to store data online so it can be accessed at 
any time even if the user uninstalls the application from their device. 

**New Features of Our Own**

1.	In App Notifications, when user has upcoming payments for the next 5 days.

2.	Alerts for creating budget limits per category.

3.	Payment reminder screen to set notification.

4.	In App Notification, when a user spends over R6000 for a selected time.

**App Functionality**

1. App Launcher Screen

•	Opens with a greeting, app logo, and options to either register or log in.

2. Register Screen

•	Allows users to create a profile by providing their first name, last name, username, email, phone number, and password. All details are saved to the database.

3. Login Screen

•	Allows users to log in based on their username and password, which are verified against the stored data in the database.

4. Get Started Screen

•	Recently added expenses (highlighted in an orange block)

•	Recently added income (highlighted in a green block)

•	Balance (displayed in a black block)

13.Menu

**Gamification:**

The application utilizes gamification rules by implementing, min and max for budgeting, displays a different cat image for different goals reached.

**Animation:**

When an income is added there is a cat that loads until the income is saved.

**Visual Graphs:**

Utilizes 2 graphs, graphs that visually represent data.

1.	Home screen displays budgeting progress against budget max and min and spending price.

2.	Categories, total amount for each category displayed through a pie chart.

We hope this app provides valuable financial management tools for users!
